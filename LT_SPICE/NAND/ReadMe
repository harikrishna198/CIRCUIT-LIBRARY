NAND Gate is a basically digital logic gate is complement of NAND gate. NAND gate behaves according to the truth table.
The Inputs of the NAND gate is HIGH(1) then the output is LOW(0), otherwise the output will be HIGH(1). 

AND Gate can implement by using diodes, transistors, COMS, PMOS, NMOS.

I am implementing the circuit using CMOS.
CMOS is basically design by PMOS and NMOS. 
Inputs of the circuit is A,B. Output of the circuit will be Y. You can see the design in the schematic.
Input  Output
A	B	  A AND B
0	0	    1
0	1	    1
1	0	    1
1	1	    0

Analytical representation:-
The  logical expression of the circuit Y = 1-(A.B) .
f(0,0) = 1-(0*0) = 1
f(0,1) = 1-(0*1) = 1
f(1,0) = 1-(1*0) = 1
f(1,1) = 1-(1*1) = 0
