nor Gate is a basically digital logic gate is complement of OR gate. NOR gate behaves according to the truth table.
The Inputs of the NAND gate are LOW(0) then the output is HIGH(1), otherwise the output will be LOW(0). 

NOR Gate can implement by using diodes, transistors, COMS, PMOS, NMOS and gates.

I am implementing the circuit using CMOS.
CMOS is basically design by PMOS and NMOS. 
Inputs of the circuit is A,B. Output of the circuit will be Y. You can see the design in the schematic.
Input  Output
A	B	  A AND B
0	0	    1
0	1	    0
1	0	    0
1	1	    0

Analytical representation:-
The  logical expression of the circuit Y = 1-(A+B) .
f(0,0) = 1-(0+0) = 1
f(0,1) = 1-(0+1) = 0
f(1,0) = 1-(1+0) = 0
f(1,1) = 1-(1+1) = 0
