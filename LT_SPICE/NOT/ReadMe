Not Gate is a basically invertor circuit, it is a logical negation. Not gate behaves according to the truth table.
The Inputs of the NOT gate is HIGH(1) then the output is Low(0). 

AND Gate can implement by using  COMS, PMOS, NMOS.

I am implementing the circuit using CMOS.
CMOS is basically design by PMOS and NMOS. 
Inputs of the circuit is A. Output of the circuit will be Y. You can see the design in the schematic.
Input  Output
A		    Y
0		    1
1		    0

Analytical representation:-
The  logical expression of the circuit Y = 1-A
f(0) = 1-0 = 1. 
f(1) = 1-1 = 0.

.ASC files are the schematic and test files and .asy files are the test files.
