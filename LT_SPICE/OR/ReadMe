OR Gate is a basically digital logic gate that implements logical disjuntion. OR gate behaves according to the truth table.
The Inputs of the OR gate is LOW(0) then the output is LOW(0), otherwise the output will be High(1). 

AND Gate can implement by using diodes, transistors, COMS, PMOS, NMOS.

I am implementing the circuit using CMOS.
CMOS is basically design by PMOS and NMOS. 
Inputs of the circuit is A,B. Output of the circuit will be Y. You can see the design in the schematic.
Input  Output
A	B	  A AND B
0	0	    0
0	1	    1
1	0	    1
1	1	    1

Analytical representation:-
The  logical expression of the circuit Y = A+B .
f(0,0) = 0+0 = 0
f(0,1) = 0+1 = 1
f(1,0) = 1+0 = 1
f(1,1) = 1+1 = 1

.ASC files are the schematic and test files and .asy files are the test files.
You can access those files by LT Spice Software.
