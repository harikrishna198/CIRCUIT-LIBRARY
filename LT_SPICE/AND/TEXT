AND Gate is a basically digital logic gate that implements logical conjuntion. AND gate behaves according to the truth table.
The Inputs of the AND gate is HIGH(1) then the output is HIGH(1), otherwise the output will be low(0). 

AND Gate can implement by using diodes, transistors, COMS, PMOS, NMOS.

Input	|Output
A	B	  |A AND B
0	0	    0
0	1	    0
1	0	    0
1	1	    1
